## 🚀 How to Use

### For Demos:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/dallas/VSInsights/vs-insights-poc
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser:** http://localhost:3000

3. **Try an example problem** (click any example link)

4. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for agents to process

5. **Explore results:**
   - Expand the purple "First Principles / Munger" section
   - See mental models applied
   - Review framework recommendations

### Example Problems:

1. **SaaS Scaling** (tested successfully):
   - "How do I scale a SaaS business from $1M to $10M ARR while maintaining product quality?"

2. **Supply Chain:**
   - "Design a supply chain optimization system for a manufacturing company with 50+ global suppliers"

3. **Content Strategy:**
   - "Build a content strategy that drives organic growth without relying on paid advertising"

## 💡 Key Differentiators

### 1. Munger-Style Reasoning (Agent 3)
The crown jewel of this system is Agent 3, which uses Claude Opus 4 to apply Charlie Munger's mental models:
- **Latticework thinking** across multiple disciplines
- **Inversion analysis** (what would guarantee failure?)
- **Second-order effects** (consequences of consequences)
- **Constraint identification** (physical, economic, behavioral, systemic)

### 2. Multi-Model Architecture
Different AI models for different thinking styles:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 for structured analysis
- Claude Opus 4 for deep philosophical reasoning
- Ready to integrate GPT-4o and Gemini for specialized tasks

### 3. VS Insights Methodology
Every framework includes:
- VS Insights fit score (1-10)
- Implementation complexity assessment
- Tradeoff analysis
- Practical action steps

   - Show stakeholders the Munger reasoning output
   - Demonstrate framework comparison

2. **Gather Feedback**
   - What additional agents would be valuable?
   - Which output formats are most useful?
   - What integrations are needed?

3. **Plan Phase 2**
   - Prioritize remaining agents (Research, Visual, Scope of Work)
   - Design database schema
   - Plan Pinecone integration
