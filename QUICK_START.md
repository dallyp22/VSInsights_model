## 🎯 Example Problems (Click to Try)

### Problem 1: SaaS Scaling (Tested ✅)
"How do I scale a SaaS business from $1M to $10M ARR while maintaining product quality?"

**What to look for:**
- Mental models: Circle of Competence, Margin of Safety, Incentive Alignment
- Inversion: What would guarantee failure?
- Second-order effects: Consequences of hiring too fast
- Framework: 3 options with VS Insights fit scores

### Problem 2: Supply Chain
"Design a supply chain optimization system for a manufacturing company with 50+ global suppliers"

### Problem 3: Content Strategy
"Build a content strategy that drives organic growth without relying on paid advertising"

## 🧠 The Munger Magic

Agent 3 uses **Claude Opus 4** (the most powerful reasoning model) to apply Charlie Munger's mental models:

### You'll See:
- **Fundamental Truths** - What's actually true when you strip away assumptions
- **Latticework Models** - Mental models from multiple disciplines
- **Inversion Analysis** - What would guarantee failure?
- **Second-Order Effects** - Consequences of consequences
- **Key Insights** - Actionable wisdom

### Mental Models You Might See:
- Circle of Competence
- Margin of Safety
- Incentive Superresponse
- Systems Thinking
- Constraint Theory
- Probabilistic Thinking

## 🎨 UI Guide

### Color Coding
- 🔵 **Blue** - Context Extraction
- 🟢 **Green** - Problem Decomposition
- 🟣 **Purple** - First Principles / Munger (Special highlight!)
- 🟠 **Orange** - Framework Architecture

### Interactions
- **Click** example links to auto-fill problem
- **Expand/collapse** sections by clicking headers
- **Reset** with "Solve Another Problem" button

## ⚡ Performance

| Metric | Expected |
|--------|----------|
| Processing time | 30-100 seconds |
| Context Extraction | ~10 seconds |
| Decomposition | ~15 seconds |
| Munger Reasoning | ~40 seconds (deepest) |
| Framework | ~20 seconds |

**Note:** Munger reasoning takes longest because it's doing the deepest philosophical analysis.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Server won't start
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is in use
lsof -i :3000

# Kill any process using port 3000
kill -9 <PID>

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### Problem: API errors
- Check `.env.local` file exists
- Verify API keys are not expired
- Check API credit balance

### Problem: Results don't appear
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify server logs for API failures
- Confirm agents completed without errors

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Watch the Console
Server logs show each agent's progress:
```
🔍 Agent 0: Context Extraction - Starting...
✅ Agent 0: Context Extraction - Completed
```

### 2. Compare Frameworks
Framework architecture provides multiple options - compare:
- VS Insights fit scores
- Implementation complexity
- Scalability potential

### 3. Focus on Munger Section
The First Principles / Munger section contains the most valuable insights:
- Mental models show HOW to think about the problem
- Inversion shows what to AVOID
- Key insights show WHERE to focus

### 4. Try Different Problem Types
The system adapts to different domains:
- **Strategy**: Business scaling, market positioning
- **Operations**: Process optimization, supply chain
- **Technology**: System design, architecture
- **Financial**: Budgeting, investment decisions
- **Marketing**: Growth, positioning, content

## 🚨 Important Notes

### What This PoC Does:
✅ Demonstrates 4-agent pipeline  
✅ Shows Munger-style reasoning  
✅ Generates framework options  
✅ Beautiful UI with progress tracking  

### What This PoC Doesn't Do (Yet):
❌ Persist sessions (lost on restart)  
❌ Stream results in real-time  
❌ Generate visual diagrams  
❌ Export to PDF  
❌ Support multiple users  

---

## 🎉 Ready to Demo!

The system is **fully operational** and ready to showcase.

**Recommended demo flow:**
