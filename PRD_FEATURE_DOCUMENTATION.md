## üìù Example PRD Output

For a manufacturing sequencing problem, the PRD includes:

### Functional Requirements Example:
```
FR-001: Real-Time Production Monitoring
Category: Core Monitoring
Priority: Must Have
- System must display current status of all 9 manufacturing lines
- Update frequency must be ‚â§5 seconds
- Display changeover status and remaining time
- Alert on line stoppages within 10 seconds
```

### User Story Example:
```
US-003: As a Production Supervisor, I want to see real-time 
changeover status across all lines, so that I can proactively 
manage transitions and minimize downtime.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dashboard shows current changeover type for each line
- Estimated completion time displayed
- Historical changeover duration comparison
- Alert when changeover exceeds expected duration
```

### Technical Architecture Example:
```
Component: Real-Time Data Collector
Purpose: Poll manufacturing PLCs and aggregate production state
Technologies: Node.js, MQTT broker, TimescaleDB
Interfaces: REST API, WebSocket streaming, PLC protocol adapters
```

## üîß How to Use

### For End Users:

1. **Solve a problem** through the 4-agent pipeline
2. **Review framework options** in results
3. **Click "Generate PRD"** on your chosen framework
4. **Wait 60-90 seconds** for Claude Opus 4 to create PRD
5. **Explore the PRD** - collapsible sections with full specifications
6. **Hand off to developers** - everything they need is there

### For Developers:

The PRD includes everything needed to start building:
- ‚úÖ Functional requirements with acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Technical architecture with component specs
- ‚úÖ Data model specifications
- ‚úÖ Integration requirements
- ‚úÖ User stories for sprint planning
- ‚úÖ Phase-by-phase implementation roadmap
- ‚úÖ Success metrics and KPIs
- ‚úÖ Risk register with mitigations

---

## üéØ Value Proposition

### Before (Framework Only):
- High-level architecture
- Component list
- Basic implementation assessment
- **NOT actionable for developers**

### After (With PRD):
- Detailed functional requirements
- Complete technical specifications
- User stories for agile sprints
- Phase-by-phase roadmap
- Risk mitigation strategies
- **Immediately actionable for development teams**

---

## üí° Best Practices

### When to Generate PRD:
‚úÖ After reviewing all framework options  
‚úÖ When stakeholders agree on an approach  
‚úÖ Before engaging development team  
‚úÖ When you need detailed cost/timeline estimates  

### When NOT to Generate PRD:
‚ùå Still exploring problem space  
‚ùå Framework requirements unclear  
‚ùå Not ready to commit to implementation
